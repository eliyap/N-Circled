# N-Circled
 Swift Student Challenge Submission

Description: interactive educational tool for learning about Fourier series
Goal: draw a shape (using PencilKit). We will trace the shape using a Fourier series.
- the number of terms in the series can be adjusted in UI
- animate the circular rotations that compose the series
	- tapping on the circle will highlight its movement within in the series

Frameworks to use:
- Accelerate for DFT
- SwiftUI for UI
- PencilKit for drawing
